    "text": "Why R for data visualization?\nChoosing R for data visualization, particularly when leveraging the grammar of graphics through packages like {ggplot2}, offers several compelling reasons:\n\nR is open source and freely available, making it accessible to a broad of users.\nR, especially with {ggplot2}, is renowned for producing high-quality and publication-ready visualizations.\nThe grammar of graphics provides a systematic and structured approach to data visualization. With {ggplot2} (and its extensions), users can describe the components of a plot using layers, making it easy to create complex visualizations while maintaining code readability.\nR has a vibrant and active user community, including statisticians, data scientists, and methodologists.\nR, with packages like {plotly} and {Shiny}, supports the creation of interactive visualizations."
