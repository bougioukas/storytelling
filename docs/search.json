This consolidated open access hub allows users to employ diverse visualization methods, from statistical plots to cartograms.\nTHE MAIN IDEA\nInitially, a basic plot idea can be generated in natural language using ChatGPT. Once the initial concept is established, the application can transition to R. Through an iterative process of interaction between ChatGPT and R, users can gradually refine and evolve their initial plot idea into a more sophisticated and insightful visualization."

With {ggplot2} (and its extensions), users can describe the components of a plot using layers, making it easy to create complex visualizations while maintaining code readability.\nR has a vibrant and active user community, including statisticians, data scientists, and methodologists.\nR, with packages like {plotly} and {Shiny}, supports the creation of interactive visualizations."

    "text": "STORY: Cocoa bean production by region\nWe requested information for “Cocoa bean production by region: Africa, Asia, South America, North America, and Oceania” from ChatGTP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ChatGPT 3.5\n\n\n\nYou\nI need information for “Cocoa bean production by region: Africa, Asia, South America, North America, and Oceania”.\n\nChatGPT\nAs of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I can provide you with a general overview of cocoa bean production by region. However, please note that specific figures may have changed since then, so it’s advisable to consult the latest reports or databases for the most up-to-date information. Here’s a general breakdown of cocoa bean production by region:\n\n\nAfrica:\n\nAfrica is the largest producer of cocoa beans, accounting for a significant majority of the world’s production.\nThe leading cocoa-producing countries in Africa include Ivory Coast (Côte d’Ivoire), Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon.\nIvory Coast and Ghana are particularly dominant in global cocoa production, collectively contributing a substantial portion of the world’s cocoa output.\n\n\n\nAsia:\n\nIndonesia is a major producer of cocoa beans in Asia.\nOther countries in Asia, such as Malaysia and the Philippines, also contribute to cocoa production, although their output may be comparatively smaller than African countries.\n\n\n\nSouth America:\n\nSouth America is another significant region for cocoa production.\nThe leading cocoa-producing country in South America is Ecuador, followed by countries like Brazil and Peru.\n\n\n\nNorth America:\n\nCocoa is not native to North America, so the region doesn’t play a major role in global cocoa production.\nHowever, some countries in Central America, such as the Dominican Republic and Mexico, do produce cocoa to a certain extent.\n\n\n\nOceania:\n\nOceania has limited cocoa production compared to other regions.\nPapua New Guinea is one of the countries in Oceania that contributes to global cocoa production.\n\n\n\nCocoa production is influenced by factors such as climate, soil conditions, and economic considerations. The industry also faces challenges related to sustainability, fair trade practices, and environmental concerns.\nFor the most recent and detailed information, it is recommended to refer to reports from organizations like the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO), or other relevant agricultural and trade sources."

The labs function is used to set the plot title and axis labels, and theme_minimal is applied to use a minimal theme for the plot.\n\n\n\nIf we execute the code provided by ChatGPT in R, the output is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ChatGPT 3.5\n\n\n\nYou:\nChatGPT:\n\n\n\ndat_cocoa &lt;- dat_cocoa |&gt; \n  mutate(region_rev = factor(region, levels = rev(c(\"Africa\", \"Asia\", \n                                                    \"South America\", \n                                                    \"North America\", \"Oceania\"))))\n\n# Custom color palette\nmy_colors &lt;- rev(c(\"#B577B0\", \"#339D98\", \"#A05961\", \"#EA8B7B\", \"#AE7253\"))\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  y = seq(10^6, 5*10^6, by = 10^6),\n  xmin = rep(1961, 5),\n  xmax = rep(2021, 5)\n)\n\n\n\n\n# Create an area plot with ggplot2, specify order for 'region', customize color palette, and add category labels\np &lt;- ggplot(dat_cocoa, aes(x = year, y = cocoa_beans, fill = region_rev)) +\n  geom_area() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = my_colors) +  # Customize color palette\n  labs(title = \"Cocoa bean production by region, 1961 to 2021\",\n       subtitle = \"Global production of cocoa beans, measured in tonnes of production per year.\", \n       caption = \"**Data source:** Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\", \n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Cocoa Beans\") +\n  theme(plot.margin = margin(5, 110, 45, 14),\n        text=element_text(family=\"Lato\"),\n        panel.background = element_blank(),\n    plot.title = element_text(\n      family = \"Playfair Display\",\n      color = \"grey20\",\n      size = 37,\n      hjust = -0.37),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(\n      color = \"grey30\",\n      size = 21,\n      hjust = -0.32),\n    plot.caption = element_markdown(\n      color = \"grey30\",\n      size = 21, hjust = -0.31, margin = margin(t = 30)),\n    axis.title = element_blank(),\n    axis.text = element_text(color = \"grey30\", size = 20, margin = margin(t = 4)),\n    axis.ticks.length.x=unit(0.05,\"inch\"),\n    axis.ticks.x=element_line(color = \"grey30\"),\n    #panel.grid.major.y= element_line(color = \"grey70\", linetype = \"dashed\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"none\") +  # Remove legend\n  geom_linerange(data = df, aes(y = y, xmin = xmin, xmax = xmax), color = \"grey35\", linetype = \"dotted\", inherit.aes = F, alpha = 0.40)\n\n\n\n\nfinal_dat &lt;- dat_cocoa %&gt;% \n  filter(year==\"2021\")%&gt;%  # Keep only 2021 value\n  arrange(desc(region_rev)) %&gt;%                # Inverse factor order (first is at the bottom of plot)\n  mutate(                              # Create new column ypos and\n    ypos=cumsum(cocoa_beans) - 0.5 * cocoa_beans      # fill with cumulative sum of invest for 2017\n  )                                     \n\nfinal_dat$ypos[4] &lt;- 5400000\n\n\n# Add text labels at the end of the graph\np + geom_text(size = 7, hjust = 0,\n  data=final_dat,              # Different data than the main plot\n  aes(max(dat_cocoa$year) + 0.3,\n    y=ypos,label=region_rev, color = region_rev)   # y and lab in the aes() (change between labels)              # x is the same for all labels\n) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = my_colors) +   # Customize color palette\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1961, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2021), \n                     labels = c(1961, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2021)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format(scale = 1e-6, suffix = \" million t\")) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1960, 2032), expand = FALSE) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = Inf, y = -Inf, label = \"OurWorldInData.org/agricultural-production | CC BY\"), \n            size = 7.2, hjust = 0.9, vjust = 7.5, color = \"grey30\")"
