**ORIGINAL CHART:** [Cocoa Bean Production by Region, 1961 to 2021](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cocoa-beans-production-by-region)


An area chart, also known as a **stacked** area chart, is a type of data visualization that displays quantitative data over a continuous interval or time period. It is similar to a line chart but with the area below the lines filled in, usually with colors representing different categories or groups within the data.

## STORY: Cocoa bean production by region

The cocoa bean, also referred to as cocoa, is the dried and fully fermented fatty seed of [Theobroma cacao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theobroma_cacao), from which cocoa solids and cocoa oil are extracted. The "beans" are the essential ingredient for chocolate and cacao products. Products received from cocoa beans are not only used in chocolates, but also in a wide range of food products.

## ![](img/cocoa.png){width=3%} Cocoa bean production by region: Africa, Asia, South America, North America, and Oceania

Here's a general breakdown of cocoa bean production by region:

1. **Africa:**
   - Africa is the largest producer of cocoa beans, accounting for a significant majority of the world's production.
   - The leading cocoa-producing countries in Africa include Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire), Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon.
   - Ivory Coast and Ghana are particularly dominant in global cocoa production, collectively contributing a substantial portion of the world's cocoa output.

2. **Asia:**
   - Indonesia is a major producer of cocoa beans in Asia.
   - Other countries in Asia, such as Malaysia and the Philippines, also contribute to cocoa production, although their output may be comparatively smaller than African countries.

3. **South America:**
   - South America is another significant region for cocoa production.
   - The leading cocoa-producing country in South America is Ecuador, followed by countries like Brazil and Peru.

4. **North America:**
   - Cocoa is not native to North America, so the region doesn't play a major role in global cocoa production.
   - However, some countries in Central America, such as the Dominican Republic and Mexico, do produce cocoa to a certain extent.

5. **Oceania:**
   - Oceania has limited cocoa production compared to other regions.
   - Papua New Guinea is one of the countries in Oceania that contributes to global cocoa production.

Cocoa production is influenced by factors such as climate, soil conditions, and economic considerations. The industry also faces challenges related to sustainability, fair trade practices, and environmental concerns.

## `r fa("r-project", fill = "#0008C1")`: STEP-BY-STEP CHART RECREATION


### STEP 0: Packages and data preparation


First, we load the necessary packages and fonts.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# load packages
library(ggtext)
library(showtext)
library(here)
library(tidyverse)

# load custom fonts
font_add_google("Playfair Display", regular.wt = 400)
font_add_google("Lato", regular.wt = 400)
showtext_auto()

```


<br>


::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## `r fa("database", fill = "#0008C1")` DATA SOURCE

Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2023) – processed by Our World in Data. Additionally, we filtered the dataset, keeping the following world regions (entities): Africa, Asia, South America, North America, and Oceania).
:::

Then we import the *dat_cocoa* in R.


```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(readxl)
dat_cocoa <- read_excel(here("data", "dat_cocoa.xlsx"))

str(dat_cocoa)
```


```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

dat_cocoa <- dat_cocoa |> 
  mutate(region = factor(region, 
                         levels = c("Oceania","North America", 
                                    "South America", "Asia","Africa")))

```


We also create a color set:

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# Custom color palette
my_colors <- c("#AE7253", "#EA8B7B","#A05961","#339D98","#B577B0")

```



```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

final_dat <- dat_cocoa |>  
  filter(year=="2021") |>   # Keep only 2021 value
  arrange(desc(region)) |>                 # Inverse factor order (first is at the bottom of plot)
  mutate(                              # Create new column ypos and
    ypos=cumsum(cocoa_beans) - 0.5 * cocoa_beans      # fill with cumulative sum of invest for 2017
  )                                     

final_dat$ypos[4] <- 5350000
```


```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

df <- data.frame(
  y = seq(10^6, 5*10^6, by = 10^6),
  xmin = rep(1961, 5),
  xmax = rep(2021, 5)
)
```




## STEP 1: Create a basic area chart


```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

ggplot(dat_cocoa, aes(x = year, y = cocoa_beans, fill = region)) +
  geom_area()
```

The aes function is used to map the variables to the aesthetics of the plot, and geom_area is used to create the area plot.



## STEP 2: Set new colors to the areas


```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| source-line-numbers: "3"

ggplot(dat_cocoa, aes(x = year, y = cocoa_beans, fill = region)) +
  geom_area() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = my_colors)

```



## STEP 3: Remove the legend and display the continent's name next to the corresponding area


```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| source-line-numbers: "3,4,6,7"

ggplot(dat_cocoa, aes(x = year, y = cocoa_beans, fill = region)) +
  geom_area() +
  geom_text(data = final_dat, aes(max(dat_cocoa$year) + 0.3, y = ypos, label = region, color = region),
            size = 7, hjust = 0) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = my_colors) +
  scale_color_manual(values = my_colors) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```


## STEP 4: Add title, subtitle, and caption

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| source-line-numbers: "7-9"

ggplot(dat_cocoa, aes(x = year, y = cocoa_beans, fill = region)) +
  geom_area() +
  geom_text(data = final_dat, aes(max(dat_cocoa$year) + 0.3, y = ypos, label = region, color = region),
            size = 7, hjust = 0) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = my_colors) +
  scale_color_manual(values = my_colors) +
  labs(title = "Cocoa bean production by region, 1961 to 2021",
       subtitle = "Global production of cocoa beans, measured in tonnes of production per year.", 
       caption = "Data source: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```




## STEP 5: Change the text of the axes and add extra space on the x-axis

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| source-line-numbers: "7-10"

ggplot(dat_cocoa, aes(x = year, y = cocoa_beans, fill = region)) +
  geom_area() +
  geom_text(data = final_dat, aes(max(dat_cocoa$year) + 0.3, y = ypos, label = region, color = region),
            size = 7, hjust = 0) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = my_colors) +
  scale_color_manual(values = my_colors) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1961, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2021), 
                     labels = c(1961, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2021)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format(scale = 1e-6, suffix = " million t")) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1960, 2032), expand = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Cocoa bean production by region, 1961 to 2021",
       subtitle = "Global production of cocoa beans, measured in tonnes of production per year.", 
       caption = "Data source: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```



## STEP 6: Fine-tune the chart’s theme

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| source-line-numbers: "13-24"

ggplot(dat_cocoa, aes(x = year, y = cocoa_beans, fill = region)) +
  geom_area() +
  geom_text(data = final_dat, aes(max(dat_cocoa$year) + 0.3, y = ypos, label = region, color = region),
            size = 7, hjust = 0) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = my_colors) +
  scale_color_manual(values = my_colors) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1961, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2021), 
                     labels = c(1961, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2021)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format(scale = 1e-6, suffix = " million t")) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1960, 2032), expand = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Cocoa bean production by region, 1961 to 2021",
       subtitle = "Global production of cocoa beans, measured in tonnes of production per year.", 
       caption = "**Data source:** Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations") +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank(),
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_text(color = "grey30", size = 20, margin = margin(t = 4)),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.length.x = unit(0.05,"inch"),
        axis.ticks.x = element_line(color = "grey30"),
        plot.title = element_text(family = "Playfair Display",
                                  color = "grey20", size = 37, hjust = -0.15),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(margin = margin(b = 15),
                                     color = "grey30", size = 21, hjust = -0.15),
        plot.caption = element_markdown(color = "grey30", size = 19, hjust= - 0.12, margin = margin(t = -5)),
        legend.position = "none")

```




## STEP 7: Add a second caption and horizontal dashed grid lines

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| source-line-numbers: "5,6,16,19,20"

ggplot(dat_cocoa, aes(x = year, y = cocoa_beans, fill = region)) +
  geom_area() +
  geom_text(data = final_dat, aes(max(dat_cocoa$year) + 0.3, y = ypos, label = region, color = region),
            size = 7, hjust = 0) +
  geom_linerange(data = df, aes(y = y, xmin = xmin, xmax = xmax), 
                 color = "grey35", linetype = "dotted", inherit.aes = F, alpha = 0.40) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = my_colors) +
  scale_color_manual(values = my_colors) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1961, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2021), 
                     labels = c(1961, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2021)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format(scale = 1e-6, suffix = " million t")) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1960, 2032), expand = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Cocoa bean production by region, 1961 to 2021",
       subtitle = "Global production of cocoa beans, measured in tonnes of production per year.", 
       caption = "**Data source:** Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations",
       x = "OurWorldInData.org/agricultural-production | CC BY") +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank(),
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 19, hjust = 1, margin = margin(t = 25)),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),        
        axis.text = element_text(color = "grey30", size = 20, margin = margin(t = 4)),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.length.x = unit(0.05,"inch"),
        axis.ticks.x = element_line(color = "grey30"),
        plot.title = element_text(family = "Playfair Display",
                                  color = "grey20", size = 37, hjust = -0.15),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(margin = margin(b = 15),
                                     color = "grey30", size = 21, hjust = -0.15),
        plot.caption = element_markdown(color = "grey30", size = 19, hjust= - 0.12, margin = margin(t = -12)),
        legend.position = "none")
