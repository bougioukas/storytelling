The chart we are set to reproduce, originally obtained from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/), stands as a prime example of an area plot. Specifically focusing on ["Cocoa Bean Production by Region, 1961 to 2021,"](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cocoa-beans-production-by-region) this visualization offers a thorough and comprehensive insight into the evolving trends of cocoa bean production across various regions spanning the last six decades. Through the use of the area plot format, the chart effectively captures the fluctuations and distribution of cocoa production over time, allowing viewers to discern patterns and variations in different geographical areas.

**You** 

I need information for “Cocoa bean production by region: Africa, Asia, South America, North America, and Oceania”.

<br>

**ChatGPT** 

As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I can provide you with a general overview of cocoa bean production by region. However, please note that specific figures may have changed since then, so it's advisable to consult the latest reports or databases for the most up-to-date information. Here's a general breakdown of cocoa bean production by region:

1. **Africa:**
   - Africa is the largest producer of cocoa beans, accounting for a significant majority of the world's production.
   - The leading cocoa-producing countries in Africa include Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire), Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon.
   - Ivory Coast and Ghana are particularly dominant in global cocoa production, collectively contributing a substantial portion of the world's cocoa output.

2. **Asia:**
   - Indonesia is a major producer of cocoa beans in Asia.
   - Other countries in Asia, such as Malaysia and the Philippines, also contribute to cocoa production, although their output may be comparatively smaller than African countries.

3. **South America:**
   - South America is another significant region for cocoa production.
   - The leading cocoa-producing country in South America is Ecuador, followed by countries like Brazil and Peru.

4. **North America:**
   - Cocoa is not native to North America, so the region doesn't play a major role in global cocoa production.
   - However, some countries in Central America, such as the Dominican Republic and Mexico, do produce cocoa to a certain extent.

5. **Oceania:**
   - Oceania has limited cocoa production compared to other regions.
   - Papua New Guinea is one of the countries in Oceania that contributes to global cocoa production.

Cocoa production is influenced by factors such as climate, soil conditions, and economic considerations. The industry also faces challenges related to sustainability, fair trade practices, and environmental concerns.

For the most recent and detailed information, it is recommended to refer to reports from organizations like the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO), or other relevant agricultural and trade sources.

## Packages and Data  

We need to load the following packages:

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(ggtext)

library(here)
library(tidyverse)

# custom fonts
library(showtext)
font_add_google("Playfair Display", regular.wt = 400)
font_add_google("Lato", regular.wt = 400)
showtext_auto()
```


**DATA SOURCE:** Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2023) – processed by Our World in Data (**NOTE:** We filtered the dataset, keeping the following world regions (entities): Africa, Asia, South America, North America, and Oceania).


First, we import the data *dat_cocoa* in R:

```{r}
#| warning: false

library(readxl)
dat_cocoa <- read_excel(here("data", "dat_cocoa.xlsx"))

str(dat_cocoa)
```



## 1st STEP: Create a basic plot with the assistance of ChatGPT


::: {#exercise-joins .callout-important icon="false"}
## `r fa("comment", fill = "#0008C1")` ChatGPT 3.5

**You** 

Given the dataset "dat_cocoa" with columns:

- region (chr)
- year (num)
- cocoa_beans (num)

create an area plot of cocoa bean production by region over the years using ggplot2 in R.

<br>

**ChatGPT**

Certainly! To create an area plot using ggplot2 in R with your dataset "dat_cocoa," you can use the following code:

```{r}
#| eval: false

# load the package
library(ggplot2)

# Create the area plot
ggplot(dat_cocoa, aes(x = year, y = cocoa_beans, fill = region)) +
  geom_area() +
  labs(title = "Cocoa Beans Production by Region Over the Years",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Cocoa Beans Production",
       fill = "Region") +
  theme_minimal()
```

This code assumes that your dataset (dat_cocoa) is already loaded into R and has the specified columns (region, year, and cocoa_beans). The aes function is used to map the variables to the aesthetics of the plot, and geom_area is used to create the area plot. The labs function is used to set the plot title and axis labels, and theme_minimal is applied to use a minimal theme for the plot.

If we execute the code provided by ChatGPT in R, the output is:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-chartbychat1
#| fig-cap: First chart from code provided by ChatGPT
#| fig-width: 12
#| fig-height: 9


ggplot(dat_cocoa, aes(x = year, y = cocoa_beans, fill = region)) +
  geom_area() +
  labs(title = "Cocoa Beans Production by Region Over the Years",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Cocoa Beans Production",
       fill = "Region") +
  theme_minimal()
```
