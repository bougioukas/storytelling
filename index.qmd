Imagine having (almost) all types of data visualization tools and techniques seamlessly brought together in one place, creating a comprehensive and unified platform for unlocking insights from your data. This consolidated **open access** hub allows users to employ diverse visualization methods, from statistical plots to cartograms. 


**THE MAIN IDEA:** Step-by-step recreation of published figures sourced from scholarly articles, websites, or media sources.

## Why R for data visualization?

Choosing R for data visualization, particularly when leveraging the grammar of graphics through packages like `{ggplot2}`, offers several compelling reasons:

- R is **open source** and freely available, making it accessible to a broad of users.

- R, especially with `{ggplot2}`, is renowned for producing **high-quality** and publication-ready visualizations.

- The grammar of graphics provides a systematic and structured approach to data visualization. With `{ggplot2}` (and its extensions), users can describe the components of a plot using **layers**, making it easy to create complex visualizations while maintaining code readability.

- R has a vibrant and active **user community**, including statisticians, data scientists, and methodologists.

-  R, with packages like `{plotly}` and `{Shiny}`, supports the creation of **interactive** visualizations.
